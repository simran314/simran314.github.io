    <p> Turtle, (order Testudines), any reptile with a body encased in a bony shell, including tortoises.
    Although numerous animals, from invertebrates to mammals, have evolved shells, none has an architecture like that of turtles.
    The turtle shell has a top (carapace) and a bottom (plastron). 
    The carapace and plastron are bony structures that usually join one another along each side of the body, creating a rigid skeletal box.
    This box, composed of bone and cartilage, is retained throughout the turtleâ€™s life. Because the shell is an integral part of the body, 
    the turtle cannot exit it, nor is the shell shed like the skin of some other reptiles.
